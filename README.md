This is a program that simulates a solution for the "Dining Philosophers" problem by using threads. 
There are 5 chopsticks at the table (one between each pair of adjacent philosophers). 
In order to eat, a philosopher must acquire both the chopsticks adjacent to them. If they cannot, they are made to wait until they can.
